Determining the most optimal location to build a new data center for Intel

> **This Project**


By meticulously analyzing a wealth of geographical and infrastructural data, I aim to pinpoint regions that not only offer robust connectivity and scalability but also align with Intel's overarching business objectives. Through this multidimensional approach, I seek to provide actionable insights that will empower Intel to make informed decisions, ensuring the seamless expansion of its data infrastructure while maximizing operational effectiveness and minimizing costs.

> **SQL**


In this project, I utilized SQL to conduct exploratory data analysis and prepare the data for visualization using Tableau. Through a series of SQL queries, I extracted, transformed, and analyzed large datasets to gain insights into various factors influencing the optimal location for Intel's new data center.

The initial phase involved querying the raw data to perform exploratory analysis, uncovering patterns, trends, and potential correlations. These queries provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, allowing for informed decision-making during subsequent stages.

Additionally, I created specialized queries to filter and refine the dataset, extracting only the relevant information needed for the visualization process in Tableau. By selectively shrinking the data to essential variables, I optimized performance and enhanced the efficiency of the visualization process.

> **Tableau**


On Tableau, I leveraged the data extracted and refined through SQL queries to create a series of insightful visualizations that provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the optimal location for Intel's new data center. Here's an overview of the visualizations I created:

Geographical Heatmaps: Utilizing geographical data, I generated heatmaps to visualize the distribution of energy production across different regions. These heatmaps provided a spatial representation of the total fossil fuels and renewable energy generated in each northwest state, allowing for easy identification of areas with high energy production.

Cost-Efficiency Bar Charts: To assess the cost efficiency of energy production in different regions, I created bar charts to compare energy costs across states. These visualizations allowed stakeholders to identify regions with lower energy costs, helping inform decisions related to operational expenses and budget allocation for the data center.

Overall, the visualizations created on Tableau provided valuable insights into the energy landscape of northwest states, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the selection of the most optimal location for Intel's new data center.

> **My Findings**


Intel has a goal to acheive 100% renewable energy across global manufacturing operations by 2030. Therefore, I sought out the regions with the highest renewable energy percentage. This led me to a deeper understanding of the regions we should stray away from - such as Florida (4%), the Carolinas (5%), and the Mid-Atlantic (6%) - and the regions to strongly consider -  Northwest (52%) and Central (41%).

Building a data center in a region that has a surplus of energy is crucial. Data centers require a consistent and reliable power supply to ensure uninterrupted operations. A surplus of energy reduces the risk of power shortages or outages, safeguarding against potential disruptions to critical services and data processing. Additionally, regions with surplus energy often offer competitive pricing for electricity, reducing operating costs for data center operators. This led to the analysis of net energy production in different regions. We can conclude that the Northwest region (21.7 million MW) has the second highest net production behind the Mid-Atlantic (31.7 million MW). However, as balance is so critical, the low percentage of renewable energy produced in the Mid-Atlantic outweighs this immense surplus.

I further explored the total fossil fuels and renewable energy generated in each northwest state to narrow down specifically which state would be the ideal location. I found that Washington leads all northwest states with almost triple the amount of renewable energy produced than second place (OR). To put a cherry on top, Washington has nearly the least amount of fossil fuel generated of the northwest group.

> **Conclusion**


After an exhaustive analysis of energy generation, environmental sustainability, cost efficiency, and reliability factors across northwest states, it becomes evident that Washington emerges as the optimal choice for the establishment of a new data center. With a substantial portion of its energy generated from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectric power, Washington offers a compelling blend of environmental consciousness and energy abundance.

Furthermore, the state's commitment to renewable energy development, coupled with favorable energy costs and a robust energy grid, reinforces its position as a prime location for data center operations. By selecting Washington as the preferred site, stakeholders can leverage its renewable energy assets to not only meet their operational needs but also contribute to a greener, more sustainable future.

> **Considerations and Challenges**


While Washington offers many advantages for building a data center, there are certain factors to be wary of:

Climate and Natural Disasters: Washington is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. Data centers must be equipped with robust infrastructure and disaster recovery plans to mitigate the risks associated with these events.

Competition for Resources: The popularity of Washington as a data center location means there may be competition for resources such as land, energy, and skilled labor. This could lead to increased costs and logistical challenges for companies looking to establish a presence in the state.

Energy Grid Reliability: While Washington boasts abundant hydroelectric power, the reliability of the energy grid may still be a concern during periods of high demand or extreme weather events. Data centers must have backup power systems in place to ensure uninterrupted operations.

Cost of Living and Labor: Washington has a relatively high cost of living, which can translate to higher wages for skilled labor. Companies planning to establish a data center in the state should factor in labor costs when budgeting for the project.

Tax Considerations: Washington does not have a state income tax, but it does impose sales tax and business and occupation tax (B&O tax). Understanding the tax implications of establishing a data center in Washington is essential for financial planning and compliance.

Overall, while Washington offers many benefits for data center development, careful consideration of these potential challenges is necessary to ensure the successful execution of the project. Mitigation strategies and thorough planning can help companies navigate these complexities and capitalize on the opportunities that Washington has to offer.
